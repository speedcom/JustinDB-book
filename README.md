1. Goal of the book
2. The structure of the book
3. Repository

### Goal of the book

1. We are going to familiarize with chosen algorithms and concepts that have been used in modern NoSQL databases such as Amazon Dynamo or Cassandra. 

2. Practice! We will implement our own Distributed Database which will be built on the basis of mentioned algorithms using **Scala** and **Akka**.

### The structure of the book // need to be change

The following book consists of 3 main parts:

1. Theory - basic concepts and problems that NoSQL databases want to solve
2. Practice - JustinDB as an exemplary implementation of Distributed Database
3. Conclusion
