# Consistent Hashing - Practice

In previous chapter we have got familiarize with concept that stands behind the Consistent Hashing algorithm. We know what kind of problem it solve and why this is a good fit for our distributed database. 

Now it's time to write some code!
At this level of application I've decided to implement the first version of alghoritm. We know it has disadvantages but its simplicity is good for starting. If you have the feeling to make it more reliable then feel free to fork the project and create pull request (nevertheless, very good homework!).
